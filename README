== What It Is? ==
node-s3 is a simple web application for creating and manipulating buckets and files on Amazon Web Services S3. You can also use it to proxy file uploads directly to AWS.

This basis for this little app was, in part, inspired by:
http://rfw.posterous.com/how-nodejs-saved-my-web-application

The above link should hopefully provide some insight on how this app might be useful.

== Requirements ==
-'bastard samurai' http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZuo3ryNFPk
-nodejs = 0.1.31 (tested on 0.1.31)

== Configuration ==
Just edit config.js and place your own configuration values into each of the possible environment variables.

var dev = {
  ports:[8000],
  s3:{
      bucket: "myawesomebucket-dev",
      key: "somekeyfordevelopment",
      secret: "somesecretfordevelopment",
      reviewer: "bastard@samurai.com"
  }
}

var prod = {
  ports:[8000],
  s3:{
      bucket: "myawesomebucket-prod",
      key: "somekeyforproduction",
      secret: "somesecretforproduction",
      reviewer: "bastard@samurai.com"
  }
}

If you need to create additional environment variable options, then remember to modify the config#init function accordingly. The port value is an array so you can define multiple ports to listen on. When the application starts, it will create a new app instance per port.

== Fire It Up, Man ==
To fire up the application on each of the designated port options:

node app.js --env=[env option (defaults to dev)]

== Future Improvements ==

-The application doesn't save the file to disk before uploading it. Simple tweak if you need to change the underlying /upload implementation just look at the commented out code.

-The application needs a few tweaks if you want it to work with Nginx Upload Module.

-The views are baked into the controller action responses. I may consider porting this to http://github.com/visionmedia/express

== Wax It, Flip It, Rub It Down ==
If you find this app useful please tweak it to your hearts content. If you feel like sharing your modifications, please do.
